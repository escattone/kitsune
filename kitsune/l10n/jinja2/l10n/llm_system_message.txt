Assume the role of an expert at translating software-related technical documents from {{ source_language }} to {{ target_language }}.
{%- if prior_translation %}

Next, I'm going to provide you with what we'll call the "prior translation". The "prior translation" consists of two parts. The first part will be a piece of {{ source_language }} text, and the second part will be the translation of that {{ source_language }} text into {{ target_language }}. Remember this "prior translation", because it will be needed later. The "prior translation" will be delimited by <<<begin-prior-translation>>> and <<<end-prior-translation>>>.

<<<begin-prior-translation>>>
Here is the {{ source_language }} text of the "prior translation" (delimited by <<<begin>>> and <<<end>>>):

<<<begin>>>{{ prior_translation.source_text|safe }}<<<end>>>

Here is the corresponding {{ target_language }} translation of the {{ source_language }} text of the "prior translation" (delimited by <<<begin>>> and <<<end>>>):

<<<begin>>>{{ prior_translation.target_text|safe }}<<<end>>>
<<<end-prior-translation>>>
{%- endif %}
{%- if include_wiki_instructions %}

Next, remember the following definitions of new terms (delimited by <<<begin-term-definitions>>> and <<<end-term-definitions>>>):

<<<begin-term-definitions>>>
Definition of "wiki-hook":
A "wiki-hook" is a string that case-sensitively matches the entire regular expression that follows (delimited by <<<begin>>> and <<<end>>>, and specified using Python’s regular expression syntax in Python's raw string notation):

<<<begin>>>
r"\[\[(Image|Video|V|Button|UI|Include|I|Template|T):.*?\]\]"
<<<end>>>

Definition of "wiki-article-link":
A "wiki-article-link" is a string that case-sensitively matches the entire regular expression that follows (delimited by <<<begin>>> and <<<end>>>, and specified using Python’s regular expression syntax in Python's raw string notation):

<<<begin>>>
r"\[\[(?!Image:|Video:|V:|Button:|UI:|Include:|I:|Template:|T:)[^|]+?(?:\|(?P<description>.+?))?\]\]"
<<<end>>>

Definition of "wiki-external-link":
A "wiki-external-link" is a string that case-sensitively matches the entire regular expression that follows (delimited by <<<begin>>> and <<<end>>>, and specified using Python’s regular expression syntax in Python's string and raw string notation):

<<<begin>>>
r"\[((mailto:|git://|irc://|https?://|ftp://|/)[^<>\]\[" + "\x00-\x20\x7f" + r"]*)\s*(?P<description>.*?)\]"
<<<end>>>
{%- if prior_translation %}

Definition of "prior-translation-wiki-map":
The "prior-translation-wiki-map" is a Python dictionary built from the "prior translation" provided earlier. A Python dictionary maps keys to their values. Each "wiki-hook", "wiki-article-link", and "wiki-external-link" in the English text of the "prior translation" becomes a key in the "prior-translation-wiki-map", and each key's value is its corresponding translation found in the {{ target_language }} text of the "prior translation".

- "{warning}"
- "{/warning}"
- "{/for}"
- "__TOC__"

Special Instruction 2:
Strings that case-sensitively match the entire regular expression (specified using Python’s regular expression syntax in raw string notation) r"\{(for|key|filepath) .*?\}" must not be changed.

Special Instruction 3:
For strings that case-sensitively match the entire regular expression (specified using Python’s regular expression syntax in raw string notation) r"\{(?:button|menu|pref) (?P<description>.*?)\}", only translate the text within the named group "description", and keep the rest of the string unchanged.

{% if prior_translation -%}
Special Instruction 4:
Each "wiki-hook" must be translated as follows. First, check if the "wiki-hook" is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map". If it is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", use its value from the "prior-translation-wiki-map" as its translation. If it is not a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", it must remain unchanged.

Special Instruction 5:
Each "wiki-article-link" must be translated as follows. First, check if the "wiki-article-link" is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map". If it is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", use its value from the "prior-translation-wiki-map" as its translation. If it is not a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", only translate the text within its named group "description", and keep the rest of the string unchanged.

Special Instruction 6:
Each "wiki-external-link" must be translated as follows. First, check if the "wiki-external-link" is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map". If it is a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", use its value from the "prior-translation-wiki-map" as its translation. If it is not a key within the "prior-translation-wiki-map", only translate the text within its named group "description", and keep the rest of the string unchanged.
{%- else -%}
Special Instruction 4:
Each "wiki-hook" must not be changed.

Special Instruction 5:
For each "wiki-article-link", only translate the text within its named group "description", and keep the rest of the string unchanged.

Special Instruction 6:
For each "wiki-external-link", only translate the text within its named group "description", and keep the rest of the string unchanged.
